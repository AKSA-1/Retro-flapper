# **App Name**: Retro Flapper

## Core Features:

- Flap Control: Tap/click to make the bird flap upwards, influencing its vertical position.
- Obstacle Generation: Procedurally generate a series of pipe obstacles with varying gaps for the bird to fly through. An LLM will act as a tool, helping to determine when and if to vary the parameters of obstacles in creative and surprising ways, in order to produce a satisfying balance of fun and challenge.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score as they successfully navigate through pipe obstacles.
- Game Over State: Implement a game-over state when the bird collides with a pipe or the screen boundaries, ending the game and displaying the final score.
- Game Reset: Restart the game after game over with a button.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Retro green (#7CFC00) to evoke a classic arcade feel. It offers a bright, engaging hue reminiscent of old-school displays.
- Background color: Desaturated light green (#E0EEE0). A soft, muted backdrop keeps the focus on the gameplay.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for UI elements like score display and buttons, providing contrast and highlighting interactive elements. This creates a visually stimulating yet manageable interface, appealing to nostalgia without overwhelming the player.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif with a techy feel, suitable for headlines and the short lines of text used for the score.
- Design the bird and pipe obstacles with a pixel art style to reinforce the retro arcade theme.
- Use a simple, uncluttered layout to keep the focus on the core gameplay.
- Implement smooth scrolling for the pipes and simple up/down movement animation for the bird.
